This has been a big re-write of an application I found on PSC.  It was originally written by Elan Hasson.
The code from his CD Archive was, lets be nice and say, ugly.  And that is being nice.  It needed a lot of work
to bring it up to a standardized coding style just so I could go over it and modify it to my needs.

This new version supports more options than his original.  It allows you to put cd's into categories now.

First you add categories via the category managment window (from the main menu).  Then you can click the add button,
it will list the current cd(s) in the system.  You click on the one to add and it will ask you for a category, and 
a name.  It then crawls the directory tree of the cd and adds all the files into the database, you can now view them
in the treeview and search through them.  Pretty simple interface, but this is the first "teaser" release of the code.
I did this overnight last night to get a good start on a much better cd cataloging system.  You could consider this 
beta 1 if you feel like it.
